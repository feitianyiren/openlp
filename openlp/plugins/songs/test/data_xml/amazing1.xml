<title>Amazing Grace</title>
<lyrics>
<verse name="v1">
Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost but now I'm found, was blind but now I see.
</verse>
<verse name="v2">
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed!
</verse>
<verse name="v3">
Through many dangers, toils, and snares I have already come;
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home.
</verse>
<verse name="v4">
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun;
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun!
</verse>
